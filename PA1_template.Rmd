**Question**
Loading and preprocessing the data

Show any code that is needed to

Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

**To do this :**
-read in the csv data

-tidy the data so every row has a value in each column

```{r read, echo=TRUE}

getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/zehra/Documents/Coursera")
temp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",temp)
unzip(temp, "activity.csv")
activity<- read.csv("activity.csv",header=TRUE, sep = ",",fill = TRUE,quote="\"",strip.white = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
summary(activity)
activity_df <- na.omit(activity)
summary(activity_df)
str(activity_df)
```
**Question**
What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

-For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

-Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them.

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

**To do this :**
1.Already ommitted the NAs to get data frame (activity_df)

2.Sum up the setps per day (StepsSum)

3.Histogram to show the total number of steps taken each day using ggplot2 function

4.The bar chart/plot is used for categorical data and the bars can be ordered 
BUT a histogram shows continuous data and the distribution of variables.


```{r mean, echo=TRUE}
##make historgram
StepsSum<- aggregate(activity_df$steps, by=list(activity_df$date), FUN=sum)
ggplot(data=StepsSum, aes(StepsSum$x)) + geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth=150)+
  xlab("Steps") + ylab("Frequency") +
  labs(title="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day")
```

**Question**
-Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

**To do this I will :**
1.Calculate the mean and median steps per day through use of 
aggregate function to work out the MEAN steps per day (StepsPerDate)

```{r mean2, echo=TRUE}

library("plyr")
step_count <- count(activity_df, vars = c("steps"))
StepsPerDate<- aggregate(activity_df$steps ~ activity_df$date, activity_df, FUN=mean)
head(StepsPerDate, n=10)
MedianSteps<- aggregate(activity_df$steps ~ activity_df$date, activity_df, FUN=median)
head(MedianSteps, n=10)
```
**Question**
What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

**To do this:**
1.Convert the factor date col to the date class -- optional

2.Change the interval integer variable to a time variable

```{r plots, echo=TRUE}

library("plyr")
StepsPerInterv<- aggregate(activity_df$steps ~ activity_df$interval, activity_df, FUN=mean)
StepsPerInterv

##tidy col names in data frame we need for this part
names(StepsPerInterv)[names(StepsPerInterv) == 'activity_df$interval'] <- 'perInterval'
names(StepsPerInterv)[names(StepsPerInterv) == 'activity_df$steps'] <- 'avSteps'
##make the axes timeseries
StepsPerInterv$perInterval<- ts(StepsPerInterv$perInterval)
StepsPerInterv$avSteps<- ts(StepsPerInterv$avSteps)
##use the time series plot function
plot.ts(StepsPerInterv$perInterval, StepsPerInterv$avSteps, 
     type = "l", 
     col = "green", 
     lwd = 3,
     xlab = "5 min interval",
     ylab = "average ",
     main = "Av No of Steps across all days -- 835 interval has most steps")

library("ggplot2")
ggplot(StepsPerInterv, aes(perInterval, avSteps)) + geom_line() +
  xlab("interval") + ylab("steps")
```

**835 is the interval with the highest number of steps.**


**Question**Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

**To do this:**
1.Check the activity data frame see where the NAs are , they are all in steps column
Use the sum function to get the no of NAs (NA_number)The total number of rows with NAs is 2304.

2.Get the rows with NAs to create a new df (NA_df)

3.Insert the mean steps to that NA_df to overwrite NAs

```{r imputing missing values, echo=TRUE}

##tidy col names in data frame we need for this part
names(StepsPerDate)[names(StepsPerDate) == 'activity_df$date'] <- 'perDate'
names(StepsPerDate)[names(StepsPerDate) == 'activity_df$steps'] <- 'avSteps'
##tidy col names in data frame we need for this part
names(StepsPerInterv)[names(StepsPerInterv) == 'activity_df$interval'] <- 'perInterval'
names(StepsPerInterv)[names(StepsPerInterv) == 'activity_df$steps'] <- 'avSteps'


##subset to find which rows have the NAs
NA_number <-sum(is.na(activity$steps))
NA_df <-activity[!complete.cases(activity), ]

names(NA_df)[names(NA_df)=="steps"] <- "avSteps"
names(NA_df)[names(NA_df)=="date"] <- "perDate"

##list/get the dates & can see these dates are not in StepsPerDate so use mean steps from interval df
date_in_df <- unique(NA_df$perDate)
NA_df$perDate <- as.Date(NA_df$perDate)

##Strategy for NAs --extract avSteps from StepsPerInterv& insert to NA_df-- NOTE this is a subset of activity df hence replacing all values
NA_df$avSteps <- StepsPerInterv[StepsPerInterv$perInterval %in% NA_df$interval,"avSteps"]

```
**Question**
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 

What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps? (step_total)

**To do this**
4.Replace NAs on activity to make new dataset called activity_complete - using replace function

5.Make the histogram (title="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day NAs replaced")

6.Re-use the mean and median calcs
```{r imputing missing values on original dataset, echo=TRUE}

summary(activity)
str(activity)

activity_complete<- activity

##rename the NA_Df cols to match the df we will fill in
colnames(NA_df) <- c("steps", "date","interval")

activity_complete$date <- as.Date(activity_complete$date)

##merge activity_complete and NA_df
##full_activity <- merge(activity_complete, NA_df, by=	c("date","interval"), all=TRUE,suffixes=c(".activity_complete", ".NA_df"))

##impute only missing values-- use the NA_df subset to get interval averages
activity_complete$steps[is.na(activity_complete$steps)] <- NA_df$steps

#remove empty cols
str(activity_complete)

##make histogram
StepsSum<- aggregate(activity_complete$steps, by=list(activity_complete$date), FUN=sum)
ggplot(data=StepsSum, aes(StepsSum$x)) + geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth=150)+
  xlab("Steps") + ylab("Frequency") +
  labs(title="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day NAs replaced")

##mean and median
StepsPerDate2<- aggregate(activity_complete$steps ~ activity_complete$date, activity_complete, FUN=mean)
head(StepsPerDate2, n=10)
MedianSteps2<- aggregate(activity_complete$steps ~ activity_complete$date, activity_complete, FUN=median)
head(MedianSteps2, n=10)

##total daily number of steps
step_total <- count(activity_complete, vars = c("steps"))

```

**Comparison to data without NAs**

After using the mean step count per interval to impute missing values, we can see the total number of steps per day increases by 2394.

The histogram with NAs replaced shows that there is a distinct most frequent step count, this is not clear from the historgram omitting NAs.

The mean and median compared to the earlier mean and median of data set without NAs imputted: Median is no longer zero. 

Looking at both the data frames with imputted values and none: The same date has the highest average number of steps.
The same date has the lowest average number of steps. There are more averages (61) in the data set with imputted NAs.

**Question**

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.

```{r weekdays versus weekends, echo=TRUE}
str(activity_complete)
activity_complete$date <- as.Date(activity_complete$date)
weekdays <- c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')
#Use `%in%` and `weekdays` to create a logical vector
#convert to `factor` and specify the `levels/labels`
activity_complete$week_ind <- factor((weekdays(activity_complete$date) %in% weekdays),levels=c(FALSE, TRUE), labels=c('weekend', 'weekday'))

activity_complete$interval<- ts(activity_complete$interval)
activity_complete$steps<- ts(activity_complete$steps)

##use the time series plot function copying the format in: https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1
library("lattice")

panel.smoother <- function(x, y) {
  ##panel.xyplot(x, y) # show points 
  panel.loess(x, y)  # show smoothed line 
  }

xyplot(activity_complete$interval ~ activity_complete$steps | activity_complete$week_ind, data = activity_complete,
  xlab = "Interval",
  ylab = "Number of steps",
  panel=panel.smoother,
  main = "Av No of Steps per Interval (NAs filled) Plot",
  layout=c(1,2)
 )



```
